# Stock Screener

This is my first real application using the Ruby language and the Rails framework.
Please checkout this great tutorial by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/): [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/).

This application pulls stock information, especially analyst reports, from Yahoo Finance.
The stocks to be screened include those on the NYSE/S&P/Nasdaq. Once these stocks are scraped from Yahoo Finance, they are processed through correlation algorithms to rank the stocks based on historical information. This is done every night.

Users can sign up and save their stocks and see performance. They can also tweak the algorithm depending on parameters are more important to them.

Status: 0% done!
